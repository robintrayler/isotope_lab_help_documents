# Introduction
The freeze dryer is used to dry or *lyophilize* materials. This removes water and makes samples easier to grind and weigh for stable isotope analysis. Samples are frozen and exposed to low pressure inside the freeze dryer which causes water to sublimate or transition directly from a solid to a gas. The *LABCONCO Freeze Zone 4.5 Plus* is easy to use. However, improper use can damage the freeze drier or vacuum pump.

# Turning on the Freeze Dryer
1. Flip the main power switch on the left side of the freeze dryer.
